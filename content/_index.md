# Machine Learning: The Boring Parts

There are lots of articles out there about the fun, sexy parts of machine learning: neural networks, AI, online learning, billions of parameters. 

This is not that site. This site is one that I always wanted to see: the internal, boring, day-to-day work that machine learning entails. It's a collection of technical notes I've made over the years of things that have been useful to me personally and that I continue to learn on a day-to-day basis, and in many ways is the resource I wish I'd had when I started getting into machine learning.

It and its layout are also constantly evolving as I map different concepts together, make changes and edits, so don't be surprised if content moves around.

Hi! I'm Vicki. I'm a [machine learning engineer at Tumblr.](https://applyingml.com/mentors/vicki-boykis/) working on recommender systems with deep expertise in YAML indentation.  I live in Philly with my family. In my free time, I love to write about Life. I also like to think about [what technology means](https://vicki.substack.com/) in the context of society, and write about that, as well. 

I also love tweeting terrible puns and doodling tech logos.
